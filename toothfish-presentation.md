# Proposed Research on Toothfish (Dissostichus spp.)
## CCAMLR Conservation Measure 24-01, Paragraph 3
### Chilean Research Plan for Subareas 48.2 and 48.3A (2025-2028)

---

## Overview of Research Plans

* **Two separate but complementary research proposals:**
  * Subarea 48.2 (Northern and Southern Research Blocks)
  * Subarea 48.3A
* **Duration:** Three fishing seasons (2025/26 - 2027/28)
* **Research vessel:** FV GlobalPesca III
* **Primary focus:** Patagonian toothfish (D. eleginoides) and Antarctic toothfish (D. mawsoni)

---

## Key Research Rationale

**Significant data gaps exist in both areas:**

  * No data collected in Subarea 48.2 since 2019
  * No data collected in Subarea 48.3A since 2005
  
**Current understanding limited by:**

  * Lack of standardized research surveys
  * Lack of updated biological data
  * Need for relative abundance estimates
  
**Research supports CCAMLR's conservation objectives**

**Strategic importance for Chile:**

* Establish meaningful presence in CCAMLR fishing research
* Contribute to sustainable management of Antarctic marine resources
* Build scientific expertise and capacity in Antarctic marine resources
* Strengthen Chile's position as a responsible fishing nation in Antarctic waters

---

## Research Objectives

 **For both research areas:**
 
  * Obtain relative abundance estimates for toothfish by depth strata
  * Characterize size and age structure and mean length of toothfish
  * Characterize reproductive/maturity indices and species ratios
  * Continue the CCAMLR Toothfish Tagging and Recapture Program
  * Characterize bycatch species
  * Document interactions of seabirds and marine mammals with fishing operations

**Northern Research Block (NRB)** and **Southern Research Block (SRB)**

* Total of **98 stations** across both blocks (**64** in NRB, **34** in SRB)
* Stratified random sampling across three depth strata (600-1000m, 1000-1500m, 1500-2000m)

**Management Area 48.3A** (western portion of Subarea 48.3)

* Total of **48 stations** throughout the area
* Stratified random sampling across three depth strata (600-1000m, 1000-1500m, 1500-2000m)
* <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">***Note: South Georgia Maritime Zone (SGMZ) excluded from survey area 48.3A***</span>


---

## Survey Design

**Standardized approach for both areas:**

* **Stratified random sampling (StRS)** with proportional allocation
* Three depth strata: 600-1000m, 1000-1500m, 1500-2000m
* Two-stage cluster sampling for biological data
* Consistent gear configuration (trotline, 2,500 hooks per set)
* Statistical rigor: precision target of ±300 kg/2500 hooks at 95% confidence

## Survey Timing and Duration

**Subarea 48.2:**

* Fishing season: TBD
* Survey period: March 1 - May 31 (each season)
* Duration: Approximately 90 fishing days
  * 64 stations in NRB (~49 days)
  * 34 stations in SRB (~26 days)

**Subarea 48.3A:**

* Fishing season: from 16 April to 14 September
* Survey period: from Jun 3 - July 18 
* Duration: Approximately 45 fishing days
* 48 stations (~1.3 stations per day)

## Proposed Catch Limits

**Subarea 48.2:**

* Total: **188 tonnes**
  * 123 tonnes allocated to NRB (65.3%)
  * 65 tonnes allocated to SRB (34.7%)
* Based on historical CPUE with 50% recovery estimate since 2019

  * **Note**: 75 tonnes for each research block (150 tonnes total) CCAMLR’s trend analysis (2023)

**Subarea 48.3A:**

* Total: **76 tonnes**
* Based on historical CPUE with moderate (50%) recovery assumption
* Includes 25% precautionary buffer

* **Note**: No catch limit since 2006 (catch limit was 10 tonnes in 2005)
* **Note**: Catch limits for adjacent areas were 698 tonnes (48.3B) and 1,629 tonnes (48.3C)

---

## Biological Data Collection

**Comprehensive biological sampling program:**

* Minimum 18 fish measured per longline
* 10 otoliths collected per longline (approx 300 per season)
* Sex, maturity stage, and gonad data
* Tagging program: 5 fish per tonne (48.2) / 1.3 fish per tonne (48.3A)
* Full bycatch documentation and VME monitoring
* Seabird and marine mammal observations

---

## Research Timeline

**For both research areas:**

* **2025/26 season:** Initial surveys (pilot phase)
* **2026/27 season:** Continued surveys with methodology refinements
* **2027/28 season:** Final surveys and comprehensive data collection
* **2029:** Final synthesis report and management recommendations

**Regular reporting:**

* Preliminary results to WG-SAM (June each year)
* Comprehensive reports to WG-FSA (September each year)
* Research reviews to SC-CCAMLR (October each year)

* First standardized abundance estimates for both research areas
* Updated biological parameters for toothfish populations
* Documentation of sex ratios across size classes and depths
* Improved understanding of population structure and dynamics

* Conservative catch limits to minimize ecosystem impacts
* Complete alignment with CCAMLR conservation objectives
* Results will substantially improve toothfish management knowledge
* Request approval for implementation in 2025/26 fishing season
* Strategic importance for establishing Chile's presence in CCAMLR research and fisheries
